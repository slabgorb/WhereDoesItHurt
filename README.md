This is a project designed for people with chronic pain to help them track the amount of pain, the therapies applied and their efficiacy, and a general mood tracker.
The idea is for people to be able to understand what helps and what doesn't help with the pain, and to understand how the pain may be affecting the rest of their lives.
I hope this is helpful for people.
